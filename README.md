## Assessment

This one was weird, I gotta say. I'm not super thrilled with it just because it was really just mathmatical investigation as opposed to any serious coding or reasoning. Similarly, I can't seem to find any hard applications of it, but I'm sure they exist.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own.
